To use the Common Lisp wrapper package cl-lemon around the 
LEMON graph library you need a shared library version of lemon.

If you have one on your system it should be found by configure; otherwise
build one from the sources distributed in lib:

	$ cd lib
	$ cd build
	$ cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=TRUE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
	$ make
	$ make check

Then you should have a shared library called libemon.so or libemon.dylib in lib/build/lemon/

Consider doing the build in the toplevel using
	 ./configure CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-O3" CXXFLAGS="-O3"
or similar optimizing flags to make the compiler generate reasonable code for the small
trampoline routines that make up our lemon-api wrappers.
